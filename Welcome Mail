<p>Dear @NAME</p>

<p>As a member of the Joint Leadership, you have been given access to Union Church&#39;s church management system, FellowshipOne Go (F1GO).</p>

<p>The key benefit will be your ability to search the contact information for members, attendees and visitors.</p>

<p>1.) <a href="https://unionchurchhk.fellowshiponego.com">You can login here</a><br />
2.) Enter your unique username: @USERNAME<br />
3.) Enter your unique temporary password: @PASSWORD</p>

<p>For assistance and instructions on how to change your password please click <a href="https://github.com/UnionChurchHK/UC-F1GO-Public/wiki/Login" target="_blank">here</a></p>

<p>We would ask if you spot any incorrect data that you email <a href="mailto:directory@unionchurchhk.org">directory@unionchurchhk.org.</a></p>

<p>Soon we will have more guidance on F1GO&#39;s additional functionality.</p>

<p>Thank you,</p>
